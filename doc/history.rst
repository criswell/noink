Noink's Project History
=======================

Noink's first incarnation was in 1998 as a Perl-based CMS. Noink was designed
to be Slashdot-like (hell, everything in the late 1990s was "Slashdot-like")
but with an emphasis on image management. It was designed, specifically, to
host a web cominc site.

It evolved from these humble origins into a full-fledged suite of inter-related
CMS applications. By 2002 and version 2.0 it included the following:

* Blogging application
* Wiki
* Gallery
* Forum software

Noink Rebirth
-------------

After Noink 2.0, development on the project stagnated. This was partially
due to the author's increasing frustrations with Perl as a language, and
partially due to the fact that new CMSes (such as Drupal) were proving to be
so powerful, featureful and popular as to make a silly little Perl-based CMS
like Noink obsolete.

So Noink's author switched to Drupal for most of his sites (save a few
legacy Noink ones).
