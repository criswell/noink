Requirements for 1.x acceptance:
	(A) Fully working *.noi parser
	(B) Forum options
	(C) Full multi-user abilities
		(personal info edit, password remind, group functionality [not
		group editting], administrative features [delete, update,
		add])
	(D) Site archival features (with auto indexing of archive).
	(E) Mostly stable (I know, I know, that's very vague! ;)
		
Versions 0.x changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	0.0.1 -	Initial code. Basic *.noi interpreting (not sectional).
	0.0.5 -	Basic multi-user ability. Password files, cookies and forms in
		use. Foundations of group working in place (no validation code
		yet). Improved *.noi parsing.
	0.0.6 - *.noi now sectional.
	0.1.0 - *.noi now complete as initially defined. Multi-user ability
		system administration (manually edit password file), but no
		group functionality yet (likely 0.5.x). Basic system is
		working, will display *.noi files and index automatically.
	0.1.1 -	Added extra user files for extra functionality (basic
		password file does not include room for URLs, e-mail
		addresses, etc.) Extra specifics can be defined in noconf.pm.
	0.1.2 -	*.noi options added - "<include>", "<link>" and "<nolink>"
	0.1.5 -	*.noi options changed from being "<location>" indexed to being
		"<sub>" indexed ("<sub>" added). This is to allow for multiple
		image/include/etc files from the same directory (if the hash
		is indexed against "<location>" you can only ever have one
		thing for each field from that location.)
	0.2.0 -	Redone multi-user functionality. Did not like the fact that
		cookies were not secure, so implemented simple one-time-pad
		style encryption for the passwords on cookies (via dynamic key
		files stored on server in [hopefully] secure location ;) .
		Thus, the only time the password is sent unencrypted is when
		the user initially logs in (which I can't help without doing
		something client side, such as Javascript, which would likely
		alienate some users- which I do not want to do).
	0.2.5 -	Updated and bug-fixed the *.noi parser. Now has options for
		forum (which is, itself, yet to be implemented).
	0.2.6 -	Fixed infinite loop problem in password decryption (only
		happenned when a new key was created in place of an old key
		which just so happened to be the key used in current session.)
		Can we say, "doh!"?
	0.2.9 - Began work on forum.
	0.3.0 - Forum initially in place. Can post and reply. Does not seem to
		work across archivals, though (important feature!).
	0.3.5 -	Finished *.noi parser to work correctly with forums, indexes,
		and archivals (1.x requirement (A) met). Further forum work
		done.
	0.4.0 -	Forums now work across archives. Forums complete (1.x
		requirement (B) met). -NOTE ARCHIVAL OPTIONS NOT YET BEGUN!
		ARCHIVALS MUST BE DONE MANUALLY!-
	0.4.1 -	Lots of bugfixes.
	0.4.2 -	More bugfixes (now accounting for user data from both a
		previous post as well as cookie- pref. post over cookie).
	0.5.0 -	Full multi-user options (1.x requirement (C) met). Diversion
		of user/IP locking till 2.x requirements.
	0.6.0 -	Site archival began. Works, mostly, but auto-indexing does
		not work at all.
	0.6.1 -	*.noi bugfix across archives (was looking in original source
		of archive!)
	0.6.5 -	Auto-indexing now works, but produces ugly results. Also,
		on a side-note, looking at forum output, it is ugly as well.
	0.7.0 - Archivals and auto-indexing of archivals now work. Forums
		work only down 1 deep in archives (then forum management
		looses track of where it is). Last issue remaining for (D).
	0.7.1 -	Added forgotten forum clearing/thread deleting features.
	0.7.5 -	Forums now work properly at all depths under archives (seem
		to). (1.x requirement (D) met)
	0.7.6 -	Bugfix for password encryption, eliminated control/split
		characters from encryption source.
	0.7.7 -	Bugfix for password encryption, fixed occassional double
		encrypting (resulting in unsuccessful decryptions).
	0.7.8 -	Many bugfixes. Split forum options into seperate file for
		easier maintainence.
	0.7.9 -	Further bugfixes (cookie loss with non-admin and over
		forums, missing $msg_* outputs, cleaned up many debugging
		outputs, password mangling).
	0.8.2 -	Fixed problem with password decryption (second decryption
		algorythm was performing an encryption on previous password
		under old or new key, instead of decrypting. User would find
		themselves suddenly and unexpectedly logged off).
	0.8.5 -	Many minor bug-fixes (mostly involving typos in $msg_*).
	0.8.6 -	Cleaned up look to forum and to archival process. (Not so
		ugly.)
	0.8.7 -	Minor bug-fix (after click on "more" for more forum entries,
		system would display ALL entries rather than just the next
		few. Problem was simple math error.
	0.9.0 -	Bugfixes. 0.9.0 is candidate for 1.x- feature
		freeze- will test for a week.
	0.9.1 -	Ick, only testing for one hour and discover two nasty bugs!
		I managed to fix one(sloppy removal of forums left forum
		headers in place), but the other (weird activities on my
		Geekcomix web-site not found on dev. site) is still
		problematic.
	0.9.2 - Added nobanner.pm (QND style, very bad) and a few bugfixes
	0.9.3 -	Added QND background for screens (optional). Locked for
		Development release.
	0.9.5 - Bugfixes and stability fixes. Added work-around for external
		page loading. Ready for dev release.
	0.9.8 - More bugfixes, some code clean-up. Added <relative> tag for
		file inclusion. Small stability fix in algorythms used.
	0.9.9 - Fixed embarrasing archive next/prev bug (next/prev buttons
		did not work past month/year boundaries).
	1.0.0 - First stable release.
	
Requirements for 2.x acceptance:
	(A) FILE UPLOADS (arbitrary! I must have the ability to
		upload binary/text/etc. files! This should also
		be integrated in the *noi file updation [next])
	(B) Online *noi file updating and creation. This includes,
		but is not limitted to:
			i) Sub-dir creation/deletion
			ii) *noi file templates
			iii) *noi section creation
			iv) *noi section removal
	(C) Site archival auto-perusing (to reduce the number of
		iterations that a browser must sift through. Also
		an option allowing to go "back" from main page to
		the  most recent page in archive).
	(D) Incorporation of CSS as well as more striving towards]
		W3C compliance (of which I suck at right now!)
